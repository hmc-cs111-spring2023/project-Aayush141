# Design notebook entry

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you received for
last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did the feedback help
improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer something you hadn't considered?
Did it help you make a design decision? Was it helpful in addressing the most pressing
issues in your project? How will you incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you
change something about the design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

I had lots of ideas, but they were disorganized and sometimes abstract. I planned to create a list with all the types, operators an flow control stuctures - and I was told by my critique partner to organize it all in a spreadsheet, ranked by importance and order of implementation. I actually did that this week! It is a live sheet, that is subject to change, but I do think the sheet has helped ground the project and gave me clear direction for the rest of the week. I will also be sharing the sheet with my critique partners so that they can give suggestions and ideas for for other impplementations. 

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

Exciting milestones: I actually met all the "base" milestones I wanted to meet for the project. I created UnorderedString and PhonemicString. I implemented several operators, such as - subset, superset, minus, equals and equalsdistinct for UnorderedString -- AND toXcase, toIPACase, =~, length for PhonemicString. I also implemented the loop. Last week, I only had a barebones structure for only PhonemicString and the loop - and now I have actually functioning strings with several implemented functions, operators and flow control structures for two of the three types. 


## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

My largest issues are design. I knew design would be a bigger component of the project, and I need to make the language actually usable instead of what is now - just a series of implementations. 

I still plan to keep adding operators and functions, but I do think I have that aspect under control. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the work?**

5 hours on coding and implementation
2 hours on creating a spreadsheet and coming up a proper, organised list of what I want to do. 
50 minutes on filling on this notebook entry, and bringing all my material together. 
70 minutes on critiques (in class, and outside).

**Compared to what you wrote in your contract about what you want to get out of this
project, how did this week go?**
